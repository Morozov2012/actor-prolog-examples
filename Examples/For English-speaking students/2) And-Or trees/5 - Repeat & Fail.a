PREDICATES:

nondeterm:

repeat;

CLAUSES:

repeat.
repeat:-
	repeat.

goal:-
	repeat,
	writeln("Hello!"),
	fail.

/*
This program corresponds to infinity
number of And trees (proof trees).

Here is the first And tree:

               the goal statement
                  /     |     \
                 /      |      \
             repeat  writeln   fail

Here is the second And tree:

               the goal statement
                  /     |     \
                 /      |      \
             repeat  writeln   fail
                |
             repeat

Here is the third And tree:

               the goal statement
                  /     |     \
                 /      |      \
             repeat  writeln  fail
                |
             repeat
                |
             repeat

Etc.

(Arguments of sub-goals are not
showed for the sake of simplicity.)

Here is the Or tree (the search tree) of
the program:

                Sub-goals: repeat, writeln("Hello!"), fail.
                (the goal statement of the program)
                          /     \
                 repeat. /       \  repeat:-
