AudioFormat	= {	-- The number of audio channels in this
			-- format (1 for mono, 2 for stereo).
			channels: INTEGER,
			-- The audio encoding technique used by
			-- this format. For instance,
			-- "ALAW" specifies a-law encoded data;
			-- "PCM_FLOAT" specifies floating-point
			-- pulse-code modulation (PCM) data;
			-- "PCM_SIGNED" specifies signed, linear
			-- PCM data; "PCM_UNSIGNED" specifies
			-- unsigned, linear PCM data; "ULAW"
			-- specifies u-law encoded data.
			-- PCM is simply a linear (proportional)
			-- representation of the sound waveform.
			-- With PCM, the number stored in each
			-- sample is proportional to the
			-- instantaneous amplitude of the sound
			-- pressure at that point in time. The
			-- numbers may be signed or unsigned
			-- integers or floats. Besides PCM, other
			-- encodings include mu-law and a-law,
			-- which are nonlinear mappings of the
			-- sound amplitude that are often used
			-- for recording speech.
			encoding: STRING,
			-- The number of frames played or recorded
			-- per second, for sounds that have this
			-- format.
			frameRate: REAL,
			-- The number of bytes in each frame of a
			-- sound that has this format.
			frameSize: INTEGER,
			-- The number of samples played or recorded
			-- per second, for sounds that have this
			-- format. The sample rate measures how many
			-- "snapshots" (samples) of the sound
			-- pressure are taken per second, per
			-- channel. If the sound is stereo rather
			-- than mono, two samples are actually
			-- measured at each instant of time: one for
			-- the left channel, and another for the
			-- right channel; however, the sample rate
			-- still measures the number per channel, so
			-- the rate is the same regardless of the
			-- number of channels. This is the standard
			-- use of the term.
			sampleRate: REAL,
			-- The number of bits in each sample of a
			-- sound that has this format. The sample
			-- size indicates how many bits are used
			-- to store each snapshot; 8 and 16 are
			-- typical values. For encodings like
			-- pulse-code modulation (PCM), a frame
			-- consists of the set of samples for all
			-- channels at a given point in time, and so
			-- the size of a frame (in bytes) is always
			-- equal to the size of a sample (in bytes)
			-- times the number of channels. However,
			-- with some other sorts of encodings a frame
			-- can contain a bundle of compressed data
			-- for a whole series of samples, as well as
			-- additional, non-sample data. For such
			-- encodings, the sample rate and sample size
			-- refer to the data after it is decoded into
			-- PCM, and so they are completely different
			-- from the frame rate and frame size.
			sampleSizeInBits: INTEGER,
			-- Indicates whether the audio data is
			-- stored in big-endian or little-endian
			-- order. For 16-bit samples (or any other
			-- sample size larger than a byte), byte
			-- order is important; the bytes in each
			-- sample are arranged in either the
			-- "little-endian" or "big-endian" style.

PREDICATES:

imperative:

-- The play predicate opens the clip, then starts the clip, waits
-- for the completion of the playback, stops the clip, and closes
-- the clip. Parameters: FileName - the name of audio resource from
-- which audio data will be read into the clip.
play;
play(FileName)					- (i);
play(STRING/*FileName*/)			- (i);

-- The open predicate opens the clip with the format and audio data
-- present in the provided file. Opening a clip means that it should
-- acquire any required system resources and become operational.
-- Invoking this method on a line which is already open is illegal
-- and may result in an IllegalStateException.
-- Parameters: FileName - the name of audio resource from which
-- audio data will be read into the clip.
open;
open(FileName)						- (i);
open(STRING/*FileName*/)				- (i);

-- The close predicate closes the line, indicating that any system
-- resources in use by the line can be released.
close;

-- The start predicate allows a line to engage in data I/O. If
-- invoked on a line that is already running, this method does
-- nothing. Unless the data in the buffer has been flushed, the line
-- resumes I/O starting with the first frame that was unprocessed at
-- the time the line was stopped.
start;

-- The stop predicate stops the line. A stopped line should cease
-- I/O activity. If the line is open and running, however, it should
-- retain the resources required to resume activity. A stopped line
-- should retain any audio data in its buffer instead of discarding
-- it, so that upon resumption the I/O can continue where it left
-- off, if possible.
stop;

-- The loop predicate starts looping playback from the current
-- position. Playback will continue to the loop's end point, then
-- loop back to the loop start point count times, and finally
-- continue playback to the end of the clip. If the current position
-- when this method is invoked is greater than the loop end point,
-- playback simply continues to the end of the clip without looping.
-- A count value of 0 indicates that any current looping should
-- cease and playback should continue to the end of the clip. The
-- behavior is undefined when this method is invoked with any other
-- value during a loop operation. If playback is stopped during
-- looping, the current loop status is cleared; the behavior of
-- subsequent loop and start requests is not affected by an
-- interrupted loop operation. Parameters: Count - the number of
-- times playback should loop back from the loop's end position to
-- the loop's start position, or -1 to indicate that looping should
-- continue until interrupted.
loop(INTEGER/*Count*/)					- (i);

-- The get_frame_length function obtains the media length in
-- sample frames.
-- Returns: the media length, expressed in sample frames, or -1
-- if the line is not open.

-- The get_microsecond_length function obtains the media duration
-- in microseconds.
-- Returns: the media duration, expressed in microseconds, or -1
-- if the line is not open.
get_microsecond_length() = INTEGER; /*Microseconds*/

-- The get_frame_position function obtains the current position in
-- the audio data, in sample frames. The frame position measures
-- the number of sample frames captured by, or rendered from, the
-- line since it was opened. Note: this return value will NOT wrap
-- around after 2^31 frames, because the function is implemented
-- using the getLongFramePosition Java method. Returns: the number
-- of frames already processed since the line was opened.
get_frame_position() = INTEGER;

-- The get_microsecond_position function obtains the current
-- position in the audio data, in microseconds. The microsecond
-- position measures the time corresponding to the number of sample
-- frames captured by, or rendered from, the line since it was
-- opened. The level of precision is not guaranteed. For example, an
-- implementation might calculate the microsecond position from the
-- current frame position and the audio sample frame rate. The
-- precision in microseconds would then be limited to the number
-- of microseconds per sample frame. Returns: the number of
-- microseconds of data processed since the line was opened.
get_microsecond_position() = INTEGER; /*Microseconds*/

-- The set_frame_position predicate sets the media position in
-- sample frames. The position is zero-based; the first frame is
-- frame number zero. When the clip begins playing the next time, it
-- will start by playing the frame at this position.
-- Parameters: Frames - the desired new media position, expressed in
-- sample frames.
set_frame_position(INTEGER/*Frames*/)			- (i);

-- The set_microsecond_position predicate sets the media position in
-- microseconds. When the clip begins playing the next time, it will
-- start at this position. The level of precision is not guaranteed.
-- For example, an implementation might calculate the microsecond
-- position from the current frame position and the audio sample
-- frame rate. The precision in microseconds would then be limited
-- to the number of microseconds per sample frame.
-- Parameters: Microseconds - the desired new media position,
-- expressed in microseconds.
set_microsecond_position(INTEGER/*Microseconds*/)	- (i);

-- The set_loop_points predicate sets the first and last sample
-- frames that will be played in the loop. The ending point must be
-- greater than or equal to the starting point, and both must fall
-- within the size of the loaded media. A value of 0 for the
-- starting point means the beginning of the loaded media.
-- Similarly, a value of -1 for the ending point indicates the last
-- frame of the media. Parameters: Start - the loop's starting
-- position, in sample frames (zero-based), End - the loop's ending
-- position, in sample frames (zero-based), or -1 to indicate the
-- final frame.

-- The is_open predicate indicates whether the line is open,
-- meaning that it has reserved system resources and is operational,
-- although it might not currently be playing or capturing sound.
is_open;

-- The is_active predicate indicates whether the line is engaging
-- in active I/O (such as playback or capture).
is_active;

-- The is_running predicate indicates whether the line is running.
-- The default is false. An open line begins running when the first
-- data is presented in response to an invocation of the start
-- method, and continues until presentation ceases in response to a
-- call to stop or because playback completes.
